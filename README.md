# Zomato-dataset-data-analysis
* This project deals with the analysis of the zomato dataset available on kaggle.
* In this what i have done is used different python librararies:
  1. Numpy(for mathematical manipulation of data).
  2. Pandas( for categorically removing data from the csv file, organising it and then storing it into variables and then doing manipulation on that data using pandas).
  3. matplotlib and seaborn was used to plot different data relations among the data, majorly using pie-charts and bar-charts and have made observation based
     on the results of this chart.
